* My Personal Emacs

** How to install Emacs on OSX
	#+BEGIN_SRC shell
	brew install --with-cocoa emacs
	# finally link it to your Applications folder
	brew linkapps emacs
	#+END_SRC

	You can visit [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS#toc12][here]] for more details.
** Org mode
	Org mode can help you write more better and you will enjoy
	writing in this way.

	There are many features:
    - Screenshot
    - Drag images file from local disk
    - Insert github gist
    - Insert Youtube link
    - Set org mode bullets
    - Support org mode to html blog

	| Keybinding  | command              | description                                |
	|-------------+----------------------+--------------------------------------------|
	| s-<SPC> c s | my-org-screenshot    | Take a screenshot into a time stamped file |
	|             | insert-gist          | Insert embeded gist link                   |

	You can insert a Youtube share like:

	#+BEGIN_SRC
	[[yt:share_id]]
	#+END_SRC

** Blog
	You can find my blog config in the /lisp/init-blog.el.

	I often write my blog with the workflow of blow:
    - With command *blog-create* to create a new blog.
    - Enter the file name and the directory you want to store
    - Enter the title of the blog you want to show
    - Use command *blog-preview* to preview the current blog locally
    - If all things is ok, you can use command of *publish-site* .

	You need write a *makefile* in your blog site file, because we'll use *make* to publish the site.

	This is my [[https://gist.github.com/yydai/18a9e5e80547dedb5195134a5a3832e9][makefile]].

** Some minor modes
*** Disable mouse mode
	This mode is default open, so you can't use mouse in Emacs.

*** Text process mode
	The goal of this mode is to process text more easily.

	Now, I only support the line process including *SELECT*, *COPY*, *KILL*, *CUT*.

**** Key bindings
	 The prefix key is *C-c t*.

	 | keybinding | command             | description                             |
	 |------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------|
	 | C-c t s    | select-current-line | Select the current line                 |
	 | C-c t k    | kill-current-line   | Delete the current line, like *dd* of vim |
	 | C-c t w    | copy-current-line   | Copy the current line                   |
	 | C-c t c    | cut-current-line    | Cut the current line                    |
	 |------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------|

	You can find the source file in /lisp/init-text-process.el.


** Other keybindings

   The prefix key is *s-<SPC>*. In this place, *s* is *command* key on MAC.

	| keybinding  | command              | description                     |
	|-------------+----------------------+---------------------------------|
	| s-<SPC> s ; | avy-goto-char        |                                 |
	| s-<SPC> s d | dash-at-point        | Will look up the things in dash |
	| s-<SPC> s s | projectile-ag        | Use ag search                   |
	| s-<SPC> f f | projectile-find-file | Find file in project            |
	| C-;         | ace-jump-char-mode   | Jump to the char                |
	| C-,         | ace-jump-line-mode   | Jump to some line               |
	|-------------+----------------------+---------------------------------|


** Locals set

*** Key mappings
	I have mapped some key to numbers.
	| current | original |
	|---------+----------|
	| %       |        8 |
	| &       |        7 |
	| -       |        9 |
	| =       |        0 |

*** Insert link in org mode
	Use the command *link* to insert a link more easily.
	This will prompt user to input adress and description.

**** Delete trailing whitespace

	I add this to my config file. This will ensure to delete the trailing whitespace when I save a file.

	#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
	(add-hook 'before-save-hook
          'delete-trailing-whitespace)
	#+END_SRC

**** Switch the key bindings for *C-w* and *M-w*.
	 I will use the *C-w* for copy and *M-w* for cut.
